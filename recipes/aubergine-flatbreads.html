                    <li>Greek flatbreads</li>

                    <li>100g baby spinach</li>
                </ul>
            
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Cut the aubergines in half lengthways, then cut them into roughly 3cm x 8cm wedges. Put the aubergine pieces in a large bowl and toss with all the oil and a teaspoon of salt. Arrange on a lined baking tray, keeping the bowl to one side, and roast for 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>While the aubergines are roasting, put the sliced shallots in a small bowl with the vinegar and a quarter-teaspoon of salt, stir to combine, then submerge the shallots in the liquid and set to one side.</li>
                    <li>Put the peanut butter, soy sauce, agave syrup, tomato paste, cumin and cayenne pepper in the empty, oily aubergine bowl, and stir to mix.</li>
                    <li>When the aubergines are ready, take them out of the oven and tip into the large bowl with the peanut butter mix. Mix well, so the aubergines are coated in the sauce, then tip the lot back on to the baking tray and spread out in a single layer. Return to the oven for another 10 minutes, until the sauce thickens and becomes sticky.</li>
                    <li>Heat up your flatbreads - just pop them in the oven for a couple of minutes. To build the wraps, spoon a tablespoon and a half of mayo into the middle of each flatbread, top with a handful of spinach leaves, and top that with some of the aubergine mix and a few quick-pickled shallots. Fold the edges around and chomp.</li>
                </ol>
